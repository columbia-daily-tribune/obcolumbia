OpenBlock space requirements
=============================

As of Nov 8 2011:

With the current set of scrapers (business, fire, midmo_coupons,
midmo_reviews, mupolice, police, sheriff, trulia), we are loading
about 120 new news items per day into the columbia demo.

Some database growth experiments:

  Number of NewsItems      Size of database (MB
  ---------------------    --------------------
  0                        40 MB
  3697                     44 MB
  56017                    99 MB

This works out to an average of about 1.1 kB per NewsItem.

Based on this, we can roughly predict database growth
assuming a consistent average of 120 NewsItems / day:

Growth per day: 132 kB
Growth per week: 924 kB
Growth per month: 3.86 MB
Growth per year: 47 MB


Measurements were performed simply by measuring the disk usage of the
relant postgresql directory, in this case
"du -m /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main/base/5591300".


User Comments
--------------

We cannot predict how many comments you'll get.  In some automated
testing here, growth was roughly 3400 kB per 1000 comments, or 3.4 kB
per comment.  This number may be slightly high as our test script
generates somewhat lengthy comments.


Images
-------

User-uploaded images have not been implemented yet, and we can't
predict how many of your users will upload images.
Assume that there will be relatively few image uploads but they will
each be much larger than other NewsItem data.

As one small data point, http://fixcity.org allows image uploads and
has so far received 261 images totalling 70 MB.

Locations
---------

We have not measured the size of growth due to adding locations
because we assume these will not change often and there will a
relatively small number of them. The locations from the
columbia.openblock.org demo are included in the initial 40 MB database
size mentioned above.
